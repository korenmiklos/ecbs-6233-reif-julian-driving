* Prior to 1990, race only had three categories: white(=1), black(=2), other(=3)
* Starting in 1990, the "other" category was further divided into American Indian/Alaska Native(=3) and Asian/Pacific Islander(=4)
* Simply make race a binary measure (white or non-white)
assert !mi(race)
replace race=2 if race!=1

* Sex: 1=Male 2=Female
assert inlist(sex,1,2)
